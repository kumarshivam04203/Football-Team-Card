# Project Description
 * Football Team Cards web applications: processing datasets, and then outputting information to the screen.
 * In this sports team cards project, you' "ll" learn how to work with DOM manipulation, object destructuring, event handling, and data filtering.
 * This project will cover concepts like switch statements, default parameters, "Object.freeze(), the map()" method, and more.
 * We are going to use a method called "Object.freeze(obj)" which will freeze this object and prevent any changes being made to it.
